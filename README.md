Requirements for the project

The solution must have a three-layer architecture. The data access layer, business logic, Web application should be moved into separate projects.

The interface should be implemented using html, css, js technologies + Bootstrap can be used.

The application should be implemented as ASP .NET MVC (.NET Framework).

Implement differentiation of system users' access rights to application components (at least 2-3 roles).

Store information about the subject area in the database, please use Entity Framework Code First for access. Use MS SQL as a DBMS

Provide validation of user input.

Pay attention to the speed of the project, freezing of the interface when performing data loading, filtering, sorting operations are undesirable;

Code should contain XML comments (all top-level classes, non-trivial methods, and constructors).

The code should be organized so that it can be reused and relatively easy to replace the implementation of logical parts;

 Provide error handling!
 
Follow clean code rules - the internal organization and structure of the project code will be assessed no less carefully than the external compliance of the project with the task;

Classes and methods must have names that reflect their functionality and must be properly structured in the application (folders, namespaces).

Code styling must comply with the C # Code Conventions (MSDN).
